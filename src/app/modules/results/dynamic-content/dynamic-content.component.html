        <p>If you are not a network operator, and is currently relying on the cloud services of another company, you will need to check with your service provider to see if they have obtained a MLPS 2.0 Certification for the transfer of data belonging to the corresponding level of the MLPS classification. The same applies for your mobile network providers, IoT Solution Providers, and Industrial Control Systems which span across the borders of China.</p>
        <p>If your MLPS level is beneath level 4, as long as your network operator is fully in compliance with the MLPS, and has the certificatations to show for it, then you can likely rely on your network provider to ensure compliance with the MLPS controls for you.</p>
        <p>However, if your MLPS is Level 4 or above, it is unlikely that general network providers will provide services which are up to standard. In this case, you should seek further legal and technical guidance from lawyers and relevant experts.</p>
